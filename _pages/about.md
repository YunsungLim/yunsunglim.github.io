I am a PhD candidate in the MOLSIM Group at KAIST, led by Prof. Dr. Jihan Kim. My research focuses on `computationally modeling materials chemistry` to uncover mechanisms and structure–property relationships. To achieve this, I integrate conventional computational simulation methods (e.g. `Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics, and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations) with machine learning`.

My PhD work has primarily centered on porous materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Among their many applications, I focus on leveraging MOFs’ unique advantages as adsorbents. Through `high-throughput virtual screening and machine learning`, I aim to accelerate the design of MOFs for gas storage and separation. Additionally, I am interested in improving simulation accuracy with the aid of machine learning force field, contributing to more reliable and efficient material design.
