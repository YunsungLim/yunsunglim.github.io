I am a PhD candidate in the MOLSIM Group at KAIST, led by Prof. Dr. Jihan Kim. My research focuses on <u>computationally modeling materials chemistry</u> to uncover mechanisms and structure–property relationships. To achieve this, I integrate conventional computational simulation methods (e.g. <u>Density Functional Theory</u>, <u>Molecular Dynamics</u>, and <u>Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations</u>) with <u>machine learning</u>.

My PhD work has primarily centered on <u>porous materials</u>, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Among their many applications, I focus on leveraging MOFs’ unique advantages as adsorbents. Through <u>high-throughput virtual screening</u> and <u>machine learning</u>, I aim to accelerate the design of MOFs for gas storage and separation. Additionally, I am interested in improving simulation accuracy with the aid of <u>machine learning force field</u>, contributing to more reliable and efficient material design.
