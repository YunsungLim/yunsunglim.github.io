I am a PhD candidate @ MOLSIM Group in KAIST which leds by Prof. Dr. Jihan Kim. My research primarily focused on embodying the materials chemistry in computer to elucidate the underlying mechanism and structure-property relationship. To achieve my purpose, I try to combinate the conventional computational simulation methods (e.g. Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics, and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation) with machine learning methods.

For my PhD period, I devoted on ~~~
